Synopsys R&D Engineering Internship – Application

Name: Nishant Nitin Mishra
College: NIT Mizoram (B.Tech ECE, 2024) – CGPA 8.79

Why I am a Good Fit

I am passionate about Digital Design and VLSI Verification, with a strong foundation in C/C++, Verilog/SystemVerilog, UVM, and Linux.
Despite the 2024 market slowdown, I continued to gain real-time experience in RTL design and verification, working on protocols like PCIe Gen 5.0, AXI, APB, SPI, and Interrupt Controller.

Skills & Experience
Languages: C, C++, Python, Verilog, SystemVerilog, UVM

Domains: Digital Design, RTL Design, Functional Verification

Protocols: PCIe, AXI, APB, SPI, I2C, UART

Tools: Vivado, ModelSim, Git

Built UVM testbenches from scratch, implemented functional & assertion coverage, and debugged protocol-level issues.

For me, Synopsys is a symbol of innovation at the heart of the semiconductor industry. This internship is a chance to learn from the best, work on impactful projects, and contribute meaningfully. **While I may not fit the “no prior experience” clause, my journey reflects commitment, adaptability, and passion—qualities I’m eager to bring to the R&D team.**
